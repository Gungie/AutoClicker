# AutoClicker
Hi, I needed a software capable of following a set of instructions in a repeated manner, and i wasn't satisfied with the software i found online.
This was the reason behind the creation of this software.

To use my software: 
1 - New Setup, 
2 - Register Click (after you click "Register Click" the next click you make will be remembered, This function is only true for the next click if you need more positions youll'have to click first on done in the pop up that will appear then again on Register Click)
3 - Start (now the software will click in the same order you did on an infinte loop)

4 - Stop (you may have to click on stop 2 or more times for it to work it's a bug i'm still working on)
